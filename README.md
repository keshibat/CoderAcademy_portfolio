Short Answer Q&A - Include short answers to the following questions
------------

* __Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today (max. 150 words)__

One of the key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today is that Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP), as the protocol suite, commonly known as TCP/IP, emerge as the protocol. This results in the fledgling definition of the Internet
as connected TCP/IP internets. TCP/IP remains the standard protocol for the Internet.
The other key events in the development of the internet is that Domain Name System (DNS) establishes the familiar .edu, .gov, .com, .mil, .org, .net, and .int system for naming websites. This is easier to remember than the previous designation for websites, such as 123.456.789.10.
IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses allowing for 4.3 billion unique addresses has been running out about 5 yeas ago to solve that problem The Internet Protocol version 6 introduced.IPv6, with 128-bit addresses, will allow 3.4 x 1038 unique addresses, or 340 trillion trillion trillion.

* __Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers (max. 150 words)__

A web browser is a program on your computer that shows you stuff that's on the web. A web server is a program on a server computer, somewhere out on the Internet, that delivers web pages to web browsers.
Then web browsers is getting the information from web servers based on the URL.
Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses but it is not easy for a human being to remember each IP address. The Domain Name Systems (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like google.com or espn.com. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.

* __Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today (max. 150 words)__

WiFi gives wireless waves for the use of the internet. In your house, you can have your own secured wireless connection to use, with a password that only you can give out to others. There is a lack of wires, so its easier to access and use. There are many devices that uses WiFi to communicate virtually. Without WiFi, we would not be able to talk to any long distance friends, or family. WiFi helps us with our daily life, and our daily tasks. Our society has its control over things easily, and helps people get answers online quickly.
